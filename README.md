# RGFX - Retro Game Effects

[![License: MPL 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL_2.0-brightgreen.svg)](LICENSE)

Real-time LED effects driven by retro arcade games. RGFX monitors game state inside MAME and translates events like score changes, player and enemy behavior into synchronized lighting effects on ESP32-controlled LED strips and matrices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Effects** — Sub-10ms latency from game event to LED update
- **Multi-Device Architecture** — Central Hub coordinates multiple ESP32 Driver devices
- **MAME Integration** — Lua scripts monitor game internals and publish events
- **Zero Configuration** — Automatic device discovery via SSDP and mDNS
- **Dual Protocol** — MQTT (QoS 2) for reliability, UDP for low-latency effects
- **OTA Updates** — Wireless firmware updates for ESP32 devices
- **Flexible Configuration** — Multiple LED devices per Driver with custom mappings
- **Game Library** — Includes example code to help get setup quickly

## How It Works

RGFX is a distributed system with three components:

**RGFX Hub** — A desktop app (macOS/Windows) that monitors MAME's event output, discovers ESP32 devices on the network, and maps game events to LED effects.

**RGFX Driver** — ESP32 firmware that receives commands from the Hub and controls the connected LED hardware. Multiple Drivers can run simultaneously for multi-zone setups.

**MAME Interceptors** — Lua scripts that run inside MAME, reading game RAM to detect events like score changes, entity movement, and game state transitions. Events are written to a log file that the Hub monitors.

The Hub communicates with Drivers using MQTT (QoS 2) for configuration and reliable messaging, and UDP broadcast for low-latency game event delivery. Devices discover each other automatically — no manual IP configuration needed.

For the full architecture details, see the [documentation](https://rgfx.io/docs).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS or Windows**
- **MAME** 0.250+
- **ESP32 hardware** with connected LED strips or matrices

### Install the RGFX Package

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/mfurniss/rgfx/releases/latest) page:
- **macOS** — `.dmg` installer
- **Windows** — `.exe` installer

### Launch MAME

Start MAME with the RGFX autoboot script. See the [Getting Started guide](https://rgfx.io/docs/getting-started/configure-mame.html) for launch instructions.

## Development

### Hub (Electron/TypeScript)

Requires **Node.js 18+**.

```bash
cd rgfx-hub
npm install
npm start            # Development mode
npm run check        # TypeScript + ESLint + tests
npm run make         # Build installer
```

### ESP32 Driver (C++/PlatformIO)

```bash
cd esp32
pio run              # Compile
pio run -t upload    # Flash via serial
pio test             # Unit tests
```

### OTA Firmware Updates

```bash
dns-sd -B _arduino._tcp local.                                           # Discover devices
pio run -e rgfx-driver-ota -t upload --upload-port rgfx-driver-xxxx.local  # Upload
```
